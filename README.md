# LLaVA-RLHF: Aligning Large Multimodal Models with Factually Augmented RLHF

</div>

[[Project Page / Demo / Model Weights](https://llava-rlhf.github.io/)]

This branch is for testing that this repo actually runs. The README will be updated ...

LLaVA-RLHF represents the first open-source **RLHF-trained** large multimodal model for general-purpose visual and language understanding, achieving impressive visual reasoning and perception capabilities. For comprehensive details and insights, we kindly direct you to our [project page](https://llava-rlhf.github.io/) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14525).

## Inference

To deploy or play with our model, please refer to [the demo directory](./demo).

## Train

We propose a new alignment algorithm called **Factually Augmented RLHF (Fact-RLHF)** that augments the reward model with additional factual information such as image captions and ground-truth multi-choice options, which alleviates the reward hacking phenomenon in RLHF and further improves the performance.

LLaVA-RLHF is trained on 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB memory. To train on fewer GPUs, you can reduce the `per_device_train_batch_size` and increase the `gradient_accumulation_steps` accordingly. Always keep the global batch size the same: `per_device_train_batch_size` x `gradient_accumulation_steps` x `num_gpus`.

The SFT training pipeline is provided in [the SFT directory](./SFT), and the RLHF training pipeline is provided in [the RLHF directory](./RLHF).
